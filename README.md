# GLP1 Project

## Overview
Social media data has great potential to uncover novel ASEs unreported by manufacturers and explore patterns of co-occurring ASEs. 
This exploration is vital due to the individual nuances often overlooked in small-scale clinical trials.
We collected 11,185 $\mathbb{X}$ posts, 489,529 Reddit posts, and 13,491 PubMed publications related to GLP-1 receptor agonists. 
By analyzing textual content using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) technique, we identified ASEs on social media that were not reported by manufacturers.
Next, we constructed an ASE-ASE network, clustered ASEs with similar effects into groups, and estimated the frequency of unknown ASEs by training a Graph Convolutional Network model.
Our data analytics approach uncovered 21 potential ASEs on social media, such as irritability and numbness, beyond the knowledge of existing pharmacovigilance data.
Furthermore, our novel computational method successfully distinguished between frequent and infrequent ASEs (F1-score 0.81; AUC 0.83).
Our knowledge-discovery approach can be applied to any drug discussed on social media to identify novel ASEs and estimate their frequencies.
